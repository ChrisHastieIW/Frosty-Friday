# Frosty Friday

This is my repository of solutions for the weekly [Frosty Friday](https://frostyfriday.org/) set of Snowflake challenges.

Some challenges leverage Snowpark connectivity. To support this, I use the shared/interworks_snowpark subdirectory of this repository which serves as a Python package. Further details on this package can be found on the [InterWorks GitHub](https://github.com/interworks/Snowflake-Python-Functionality)
